## ⚙️ Permissions Notice

To function properly, **Anxiety** requires **Accessibility access** under:

**System Settings ▸ Privacy & Security ▸ Accessibility**

It **does not collect, record, or transmit any data** all functionality is completely local.

When you launch Anxiety for the first time, macOS will prompt you to enable this permission.  
You can safely allow it. It’s required for the app to work correctly.

## 🔒 About the Security Warning

Because **Anxiety is not signed with an official Apple Developer ID**, macOS may display a message such as:

> “Anxiety” can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.

This warning appears **for all apps that are not distributed through Apple’s Developer Program**. It does **not** mean the app is unsafe.

Apple shows this message automatically to any software that hasn’t been signed with a paid Developer ID.  
Anxiety is an open-source project and does not include any malicious code or network components.

To open it safely:

1. Right-click (or Control-click) **Anxiety.app** in Finder  
2. Choose **Open**  
3. Click **Open** again when prompted  

macOS will remember your choice after the first launch you won’t need to do this again.
